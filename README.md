# Benoggl
> This project is still under development!
## What?
*Benoggl* is Swabian (a German dialect) for [*Binokel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binokel), a wonderful traditional card game.

## Why?
Being Swabian myself, I miss convivial evenings (due to the lockdown) and started searching for an **online solution to play this game**.
Swabians are well known for their thriftiness, so it is obvious that paying for playing is not a real option.

This is why I started coding this myself.

## How?
### Backend
- Python, AioHttp
### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
